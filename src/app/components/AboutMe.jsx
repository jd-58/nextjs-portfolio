      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Jacob Deaton, a software engineer passionate about leveraging technology and coding
            to solve problems and create innovative solutions. I'm currently working towards a B.S. in Computer Science
            at Oregon State University. Previously, I
            had graduated from the University of Virginia with a B.A. in Economics. After working as a consultant for
            two years, I realized that my true passion was with coding! This inspired me to return to school to
            focus on building my skills in coding and software engineering.
