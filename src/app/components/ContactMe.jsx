        <p>
            I am seeking internship opportunities for summer 2026, along with full-time positions, and am available
            to start immediately. I am currently
            located in Richmond, VA but am willing to relocate. I also have a flexible graduation timeline and can
            graduate early, enabling me to finish my degree while working full-time if needed.
